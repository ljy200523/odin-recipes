    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>An Avocado milkshake is a creamy, nutritious, and refreshing beverage popular in Southeast Asia, Brazil, and
        Morocco, made by blending ripe avocado with milk and a sweetener. The avocado's healthy fats provide a rich,
        smooth, and filling texture, often without needing ice cream </p>
    <p> What Makes This Avocado Milkshake So Crispy?
        <br>There are a few reasons this crispy Avocado Milkshake works so well:
        <br>Allowing the buttermilk-flour mixture to come to a paste-like consistency is key to a crispiness on the
        outside and juiciness on the inside.
        <br>Most Avocado Milkshake is cooked at a high temperature throughout the frying process. This one, however,
        only
        starts at a very high heat — after browning, the heat is reduced for about 30 minutes. You'll turn up the
        temperature again at the end, locking in that crispy texture.
        <br>Paprika adds smoky flavor and has a low smoke point, which helps with browning the chicken.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups milk</li>
        <li>1 avocado, peeled and pitted</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup ice cubes - optional for a colder shake</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract - optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the avocado: Slice the avocado in half, remove the pit, and scoop the flesh into a blender.</li>
        <li>Add ingredients: Pour in the milk, sweetener, and vanilla extract (if using). Add ice cubes if you desire a
            chilled drink.</li>
        <li>Blend: Blend on a medium to high speed until the mixture is completely smooth and creamy.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately: Pour into glasses and enjoy right away, as the avocado can oxidize and turn brown over
            time.</li>
    </ol>
