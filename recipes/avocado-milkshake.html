    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>An Avocado milkshake is a creamy, nutritious, and refreshing beverage popular in Southeast Asia, Brazil, and
        Morocco, made by blending ripe avocado with milk and a sweetener. The avocado's healthy fats provide a rich,
        smooth, and filling texture, often without needing ice cream </p>
    <p> The avocado milkshake is highly versatile and can be customized to suit personal preferences.
        <br>For a thicker shake: Add more avocado, a frozen banana, or a scoop of vanilla ice cream.
        <br>For a thinner consistency: Add more milk until the desired texture is reached.
        <br>Flavor enhancements: Incorporate ingredients like cocoa powder for a chocolate avocado milkshake, a squeeze
        of fresh lime juice to brighten the flavor and prevent browning, or warm spices like cinnamon.
        <br>Nutritional boost: Add chia seeds, protein powder, or a handful of spinach for extra nutrients.
        <br>Vegan option: Use plant-based milk (almond, soy, or coconut milk) instead of dairy milk.
        <br>Southeast Asian style: Use gula melaka (palm sugar) or sweetened condensed milk as the sweetener.
    </p>
